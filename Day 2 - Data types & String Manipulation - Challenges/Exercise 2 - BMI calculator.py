#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
#The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.
#The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m)


height = float(input('enter your height in meters '))
weight = int(input('enter your weight in kilograms '))
bmi = (weight / height ** 2)
print('Your bmi is ' , int(bmi))
